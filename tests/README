1. Make sure you have latest PEAR PHPUnit installed:
  > sudo pear upgrade
  > sudo pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
  > sudo pear install phpunit/PHPUnit

2. You need PHP 5.3.2 or later to run some tests that deal with private or protected methods. If you use an earlier
  version of PHP, these tests will be skipped.
  
3. Run all tests with:
  > phpunit .
